Before submitting, please make sure that you're not running into one of these known issues:

 1. on-the-fly diagnostics are mostly unimplemented (`cargo check` diagnostics will be shown when saving a file)
 2. some platform-specific imports are not resolved: #6038
 3. attribute proc macros are not supported: #6029
 4. the version string is misleading (includes the previous week): #8571

Otherwise please try to provide information which will help us to fix the issue faster. Minimal reproducible examples with few dependencies are especially lovely <3.
